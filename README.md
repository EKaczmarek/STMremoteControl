># STMremoteControl

Overview
----------
In the project STM32F407 Discovery microcontroller is used as a connection between IR receiver and computer.

Description
-------------
Project consists of Coocox program that receives data from receiver (USART) and sends data through Virtual COM Port. C# application

-------
>- CooCox IDE 
>- Visual Studio 2017

How to compile
----------------
>- Go to /STMremoteControl/CooCox/
>- Open CooCox project (STMremoteControl.coproj)
>- Build project and save it on microcontroler
>- Go to part "How to run"

How to run
------------
>- You should download CooCox in order to programm STM32F407 Discovery
>- Next step is to run *.exe file generated by Visual Studio

Future improvements
