Project consists of Coocox programm that sends data through Virtual COM Port and C# application (Music Player and interface to manage computer keyboard). 

# Tools
-------
>-CooCox IDE 
>-Visual Studio 2017

# How to compile
----------------
	- Go to /STMremoteControl/CooCox/
	- Open CooCox project (STMremoteControl.coproj)
	- Build project and save it on microcontroler
	- Go to part "How to run"

# How to run
------------
>-You should download CooCox in order to programm STM32F407 Discovery
>-Next step is to run *.exe file generated by Visual Studio

# Future improvements
